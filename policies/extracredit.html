        <h1>Do I offer extra credit?</h1>
        <p>No. I believe that the daily assignments are important to your learning, so you are allowed to redo/resubmit them as many times as you want. 
            If you do more material than I assign, you might earn extra credit, but there is no such thing as Extra Credit beyond the lessons.</p>
